# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was the bulk of the class assignments. The company wanted to address and improve upon poor grades in driving tests by giving better lessons and practice tests. Both online courses and driving lessons are available to be scheduled with the online app.

# What did you do particularly well?
I have always been good at explaining technical things to non-technical people. I have to explain calculated fields that I create at work to people who don't know what calculated fields are, so I have some practice.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I feel my UML documents could have been better. They explained things in a very high level way, but I feel like some parts were missing. I would circle back and add in missing pieces like the DMV for automatic updates on the DriverPass site.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Consideration of user needs guided my approach to system design from the start. I crafted diagrams that reflected likely user interactions. With respect to the class diagram, I played off the sequence and activity diagrams to anticipate how each class would utilized. Without careful thought around user needs, the system design may remain too abstract to yield any practical solutions to the problems it’s intended to solve.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
One of the most important lessons I learned from this course is an iterative design approach. Using this method, I worry less about capturing all the details initially, which used to bog my speed down. I use repetitive passes over a project with each subsequent turn providing deeper insight and including more details than the last. I will continue to hone this technique in future projects.
